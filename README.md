First I install react with vite in jsx format then intall tailwind from there official site and then design the 3 pages home, news, newsview after completion create smaller component to reduce the load on a file. To check with api used https://mediastack.com/ api 100 hit free so I did it for news category wise.

The api key is still in the git you can also use as it's free credit 100 per month so practice if you want to or create your own and practice. 🙂
At the end used AI a little ✨ to create slider snap in mobile view without using any third part installation of library it's not superb but cool.
